RV is a project focusing on the Community utility, Games, and Web 3.0 created by an Art and Animation Studio called "Cabeza Rota" [https://twitter.com/rotten_ville/status/1517512268975677440 - more info about who is behind the project] hand in hand with the Rotten Community and The Rottens DAO. The project's main goal is to offer revenues and benefits from our Collections to our holders, giving way to what We call the RottenVerse.

Utility is now the main feature in every Solana Collection, putting aside the art and design behind it; Rotten Ville is a project that seeks to achieve both in balance, creating high-quality collections with a high utility for the Community, We are in the alpha phase constantly evolving, learning, and winning more experience day after day, just with the main mission of built the RottenVerse and being one of the most important and Community focused project in all the Solana Network.

Three phases of Development and Three Collections â€” We are looking to create a strong project structure based on Community and Development,  that's why our project has three development phases called Alpha phase, Beta phase, and Gamma phase each one where we as a Team are focusing on a Collection per phase with utilities and exclusive benefits.
